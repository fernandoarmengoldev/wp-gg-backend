# WP.GG

WP.GG is a League of Legends project organized as a monorepo with two main parts:

- `server/`: a Bun + TypeScript REST API that integrates with Riot Games API and stores match data in MongoDB.
- `android/`: a native Android app written in Kotlin that consumes the backend and CommunityDragon data.

Most of the original work was done in 2021-2022. In 2026 the project was resumed, the backend was moved into `server/`, and the Android client was consolidated into the same repository.

```

## Backend

The backend provides the data layer for WP.GG:

- Fetches summoner, mastery, ranked, and match data from Riot Games API.
- Stores matches in MongoDB.
- Calculates champion analytics from stored matches.
- Exposes HTTP routes for the Android client.
- Can run a background random-match collector to keep growing the dataset.

### Main backend features

- Summoner profile lookup
- Match history retrieval
- Champion mastery and ranked data
- Champion win rate and pick rate
- Best and worst matchups
- Recommended boots, mythics, legendary items, spells, and runes
- Champion position detection

### Backend routes

Routes are currently defined in `server/src/routes.ts`:

- `GET /` - health check
- `GET /api/summoner/:gameName/:tagLine` - summoner profile and recent history
- `GET /api/maestry/:id` - champion mastery by summoner id
- `GET /api/elo/:id` - ranked data by summoner id
- `GET /api/match/:matchid` - full match detail
- `GET /api/matchesFromChamp/:champ` - aggregated champion statistics
- `GET /api/position` - stored champion positions
- `GET /api/positionSetting` - rebuild champion positions from match data

### Backend setup

Requirements:

- Bun 1.x
- MongoDB
- Riot Games API key

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
bun install
```

Create `server/.env`:

```env
DB_URL=mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017
RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key_here
GET_RANDOM_MATCHES=false
PORT=3000
RANDOM_MATCH_INTERVAL_MS=5000
```

Run the backend:

```bash
cd server
bun run dev
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
cd server
bun run start
bun run typecheck
```

By default the API listens on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Android App

The Android app is a native client built with Kotlin, classic Android Views, and ViewBinding.

### Main app sections

- `Summoner`: summoner search, recent searches, ranked info, mastery, and recent matches
- `Champions`: champion list, role filters, and detail pages
- `Wiki`: items, spells, runes, and external League universe pages

### Android features

- Local caching of recent summoner searches through `SharedPreferences`
- Champion statistics screen with matchup and build recommendations
- Champion information screen with abilities, role info, and videos
- Match detail screen with general stats and charts
- Static game data loading from CommunityDragon

### Android stack

- Kotlin
- Android SDK 32
- Retrofit + Gson
- Glide
- Kotlin Coroutines
- MPAndroidChart
- GraphView
- Material Components

### Android setup

Requirements:

- Android Studio
- Android SDK 32
- Emulator or Android device

Run the app:

1. Open `android/` in Android Studio.
2. Sync Gradle.
3. Run the `app` configuration on an emulator or device.

You can also build from the command line:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Integration Notes

- The Android app contains a local emulator base URL at `http://10.0.2.2:3000/api/` in `android/app/src/main/java/com/fernandoarmengol/ggwp/network/RetrofitHelper.kt`.
- The same file also contains a legacy hosted backend URL.
- CommunityDragon is used by the app for champion, item, spell, rune, splash, and icon assets.
- The backend currently expects the summoner route format `:gameName/:tagLine`, so the Android client may need endpoint alignment if you want both modules running together with the latest server structure.

## Data Sources

- Riot Games API
- CommunityDragon
- MongoDB collections:
  - `matches`
  - `positions`
